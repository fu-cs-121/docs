Being able to use Git and Github is a key skill for any modern developer.

Below is a short, beginner-friendly guide explaining **Git**, **GitHub**, and **GitHub Classroom**, along with how they work together. This is meant to give you just enough information to understand the tools without going into excessive detail. Feel free to customize or shorten it based on your class needs.

You will learn more about Git and source control in future classes if you choose to proceed in Computer Science.

## What is Git?

**Git** is a program that helps you track changes to your files over time. Think of it like the **“save”** feature in a game, except you can keep multiple “save points” (commits) and go back to them if something goes wrong. Key points:

- **Version Control**: It remembers every change to your files so you can review or undo them.
- **Commits**: Each time you make a set of changes, you “commit” them, which creates a snapshot of your project at that moment.
- **Branching & Merging**: You can experiment with different ideas on separate branches and later merge them back into the main version.

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories online. Instead of keeping all your commits only on your computer, GitHub stores them “in the cloud,” so:

1. **You can access your code anywhere.**
2. **Others can collaborate with you** on the same project.
3. **You have a backup** of your files.

When you see the term “remote repository,” it often refers to the copy of your project that is stored on GitHub.

## What is GitHub Classroom?

**GitHub Classroom** is a tool built on top of GitHub that helps teachers and students manage coding assignments. Here’s how it works:

1. **Teacher Creates an Assignment**: Your instructor sets up a template repository (like a starter project) and invites you to “accept” the assignment.
2. **Student Accepts the Assignment**: Once you accept, GitHub Classroom **automatically creates** a personal copy of the project under your GitHub account.
3. **You Work on Your Copy**: You do all your coding, commits, and pushes in your own private repository—teachers can see it, but your classmates cannot.
4. **Automatic Organization**: The teacher can easily keep track of each student’s code in one place.

## How They Fit Together

- **Git**: The version-control tool running on your local machine (and also behind the scenes on GitHub).
- **GitHub**: The website that stores your repository so you can share it or collaborate.
- **GitHub Classroom**: The “classroom” layer on GitHub that creates and manages assignment repositories for students.

### Typical Workflow

1. **Teacher shares a link** to a GitHub Classroom assignment.
2. **You accept** the assignment and get your own personal repository created on GitHub.
3. **You open the repository** (for example, in GitHub Codespaces).
4. **You do your work**: Add files, modify code, and commit your changes using Git.
5. **You push** your commits from your local machine (Codespaces) to your repository on GitHub, so your teacher can see your progress.
6. **(Optional) Pull** any updates or improvements your teacher might push into the assignment template—or merge changes if there’s a conflict.

## Why Use All Three?

1. **Git** ensures you can track every change and revert if needed.
2. **GitHub** provides a central place to store and share your work.
3. **GitHub Classroom** takes care of creating and organizing student repositories, so each student can have their own private code while the teacher easily collects and reviews them.

## Conclusion

- **Git** = version control tool.
- **GitHub** = online hosting service for Git repositories.
- **GitHub Classroom** = platform that integrates with GitHub to streamline assignments.

Together, they simplify the process of writing, reviewing, and submitting code in a classroom setting. If you’re new to coding and these terms, don’t worry—just follow the steps provided by your instructor, and you’ll get used to the workflow over time!
