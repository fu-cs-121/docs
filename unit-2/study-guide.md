## 1. Reading Data from Text Files

### Opening and Reading Files

To read data from a file, use the `open()` function along with a `with` statement. This ensures the file is properly closed after its contents are read.

```python
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)
```

### Skipping Headers

If the file has a header row (e.g., column names), you can skip it using the `next()` function.

```python
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    next(file)  # Skip the header line
    for line in file:
        print(line)
```

## 2. Working with Data Structures

### Lists and Dictionaries

- **List**: An ordered collection of items.
- **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs.

### Examples

**List of Values**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Dictionary**

```python
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```

**List of Dictionaries**

```python
data = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'score': 90},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'score': 85}
]
```

---

## 3. Parsing and Converting Data

### Splitting Lines into Fields

Assuming data is comma-separated:

```python
line = 'Alice,90'
fields = line.strip().split(',')  # ['Alice', '90']
```

### Converting Strings to Numbers

Use `int()` for integers and `float()` for decimal numbers.

```python
score = int(fields[1])  # Converts '90' to 90
```

### Removing Whitespace

Use the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace.

```python
text = '  Hello World  '
clean_text = text.strip()  # 'Hello World'
```

---

## 4. Using List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.

### Example: Extracting Data from a List of Dictionaries

Suppose you have a list of dictionaries:

```python
data_list = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'score': 90},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'score': 85},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'score': 95}
]
```

**Using a Loop**

```python
scores = []
for item in data_list:
    scores.append(item['score'])
```

**Using a List Comprehension**

```python
scores = [item['score'] for item in data_list]
```

Both methods will produce the same `scores` list:

```python
[90, 85, 95]
```

### Advantages of List Comprehensions

- **Concise**: Shorter and often more readable code.
- **Efficient**: Can be faster than using loops in some cases.

## 5. Performing Calculations on Data

### Summing Values

To sum numeric values in a list:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
total = sum(numbers)  # 60
```

### Calculating Averages

Average = Total Sum / Number of Items

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)  # 20.0
```

### Calculating Totals from a List of Dictionaries

```python
data = [
    {'quantity': 5, 'price': 2.0},
    {'quantity': 3, 'price': 1.5}
]

total_value = sum(item['quantity'] * item['price'] for item in data)  # 16.5
```

---

## 6. Adjusting Data Values

### Adjusting Numerical Values

To adjust numerical values by a certain rate (e.g., increasing prices by 10%):

```python
adjustment_rate = 1.10  # 10% increase
for item in data:
    item['price'] *= adjustment_rate
```

---

## 7. Writing Data to Text Files

### Writing to a File

Open a file in write mode and write data line by line.

```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Name,Score\n')  # Write header
    for item in data:
        line = f"{item['name']},{item['score']}\n"
        file.write(line)
```

### Formatting Data for Writing

Ensure data is converted to strings before writing.

```python
line = ','.join([item['name'], str(item['score'])])
file.write(line + '\n')
```

---

## 8. Defining and Using Functions

Functions encapsulate reusable code blocks, allowing you to organize your code and avoid repetition.

### Defining Functions with Parameters and Return Values

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)  # 8
```

### Passing Parameters

Functions can accept parameters to make them more flexible.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet('Alice')
print(message)  # Hello, Alice!
```

### Returning Values

Functions can return values that can be used elsewhere in your code.

```python
def calculate_total(scores):
    return sum(scores)

scores = [90, 85, 95]
total_score = calculate_total(scores)
print(total_score)  # 270
```

### Example: Refactoring Code into a Function

Suppose you have code that reads data from a file and processes it at the root level.

**Original Code**

```python
data_list = []
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    file.readline()  # Skip header
    for line in file:
        fields = line.strip().split(',')
        record = {
            'name': fields[0],
            'score': int(fields[1])
        }
        data_list.append(record)

# Continue processing data_list...
```

**Refactored into a Function**

By moving this code into a function, you can reuse it and keep your code organized.

```python
def load_data(filename):
    data_list = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        file.readline()  # Skip header
        for line in file:
            fields = line.strip().split(',')
            record = {
                'name': fields[0],
                'score': int(fields[1])
            }
            data_list.append(record)
    return data_list

# Now you can call the function
data_list = load_data('data.txt')

# Continue processing data_list...
```

### Benefits of Using Functions

- **Reusability**: Functions can be called multiple times with different parameters.
- **Organization**: Helps structure your code, making it easier to read and maintain.
- **Modularity**: Changes in the function code don't require changes where the function is called.

## 9. Formatting Output

### Printing with Specific Decimal Places

Use formatted strings (f-strings) to control the number of decimal places.

```python
value = 123.456789
print(f"Value rounded to two decimal places: {value:.2f}")  # 123.46
```

### Aligning Text Output

```python
print(f"{'Name':<10}{'Score':>5}")
print(f"{'Alice':<10}{95:>5}")
```

Output:

```
Name        Score
Alice         95
```

---

## 10. Additional Tips

### Using the `len()` Function

To get the number of items in a list:

```python
number_of_records = len(data_list)
print(f"Number of records loaded: {number_of_records}")
```

### Avoiding Division by Zero

When calculating averages, check if the denominator is not zero.

```python
if len(data_list) > 0:
    average = total / len(data_list)
else:
    average = 0
```
